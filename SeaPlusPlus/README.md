C++ CLI application I made in uni.

Uses only C++ in Visual Studio

<!--
**FOR EACH PROJECT MAKE SURE TO PUT STUFF IN THE README.TXT, STUFF LIKE:** 
  - Goal/Purpurse of project*
  - *Features/what it does*
  - *design patterns used*
  - *Challenges (One of them learning C++ more properly as first application 
    made in C++ as up to this point had the theoritcals down but not putting 
    them into practice)*
  - *What do better next time (One of them being not having to pass possible unrelated or unused data through the mediator)*
